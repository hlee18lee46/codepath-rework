## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps: Weverse, Microsoft Teams, Whatsapp, Mcdonald's app.

Features I like: The ability to make posts and communication process with artists. I like the notification of my posts being liked (Weverse), The ability to chat and calls (Teams, Whatsapp), The ability to check in based on the users location after making the order at the designated Mcdonald's location (Mcdonald's app).

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Getting to know the Mac environment was challenging overall for me as I mostly use Windows. I still haven't figured out the keyboard short-cut for copy and paste. 

Another challenging part was to recognize where to put the code in.
